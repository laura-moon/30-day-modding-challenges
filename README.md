# 30-day-modding-challenges
I've started challenging myself to learn how to make mods.  I'm trying to focus on one thing at a time and avoid overwhelming myself by doing 30 day themed challenges.  This repo is for me to keep a record of what I did and any resources/tutorials I used, as well as store ideas for future challenges.
