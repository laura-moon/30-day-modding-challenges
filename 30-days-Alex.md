### Day 1 
Created the NPC record following Joseph Russell's Tutorial #1 - (Starting with Vanilla)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJB7eLcCo0c].  
Created face for him in RaceMenu.  
Exported nif and texture for face.

### Day 2
Finished NPC record using YoungMaleEager voicetype.  
Attempted to update appearance to the one I created.   
Could not resolve dark face bug - try again tomorrow.  
Also I think I am going to do custom voice type rather than use YoungMaleEager voicetype.  
Added Quaint Shelter as a master and gave Gwilym ownership of it.

### Day 3
Restarted entirely.  NPC is Alex, he just won't be called anything else.  This is just for me, save Gwilym for if I ever make a mod to be released publicly.
Fixed appearance - there was something wrong with the beard I was using.
Followed Joseph Russell tutorial to create custom follower framework  - Tutorial #2 - (Creating a Custom Follower Framework)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEVu-ujB9XU&t=2189s]
Spent at least an hour trying to work out why the script I had copied and pasted from JR's website wouldn't compile.  Turned out my CK prefs ini was looking for scripts in Source/Scripts rather than Scripts/Source.  Did also figure out how to use the Pyro stuff in VSCode though.
Followed Joseph Russell tutorial to create custom voice type and start adding audio files - Tutorial #3 - (Recording and Editing Voice Audio Files)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWvnr05bXbQ&t=674s].
Started clipping audio files (or not, as it turned out).
Merged appearance records into main plugin rather than as separate overwriting plugin.  Broke appearance in the process.

### Day 4
Fixed appearance, again.
Reclipped audio files (I had incorrectly exported all the files I did yesterday, exporting the whole file rather than the selection).
Attached audio files for the dialogue lines I added yesterday and generated lip files.
Tested in game, all working as expected.
