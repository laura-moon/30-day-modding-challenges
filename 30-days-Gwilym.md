### Day 1
Created the NPC record following Joseph Russell's tutorial.  
Created face for him in RaceMenu.  
Exported nif and texture for face.

### Day 2
Finished NPC record using YoungMaleEager voicetype.  
Attempted to update appearance to the one I created.   
Could not resolve dark face bug - try again tomorrow.  
Also I think I am going to do custom voice type rather than use YoungMaleEager voicetype.  
Added Quaint Shelter as a master and gave Gwilym ownership of it.
