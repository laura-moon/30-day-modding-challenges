# 30 Days of Outfit Modding

## Rules

- I have to spend at least five minutes every day on something related to the challenge.
- ~~Spend no more than 30 minutes a day on the challenge.~~ I broke this rule on Day 1 and never looked back.

## Initial Goals

- Learn how to implement texture sets and create a plugin so the re-colours I have already made can be crafted in game
- Personal recolour of Iron Mercenary Light Armor
- A simple armor mashup with plugin so it can be crafted in game.
  
### Day 1
I managed to get the esp created and I can craft the re-coloured dresses in game, but the new texture isn't showing up so clearly I have something pathed wrong somewhere. 
Will try again tomorrow.  I did spend quite a bit longer than 30 mins today but there was a lot of troubleshooting and reloading the game going on.  At one point the dress was invisible, that was a low point

### Day 2
I redid all the texture linking and tidied things up and it's now working, mostly \(I must have missed one of them so I need to go back in and fix that before I can tick this goal off my list\)
Resources I used to learn how to do this:

### Day 3
I MADE A MASHUP! I am SO excited.  I wanted to start simple - it's a mashup of the top of the Mage outfit from D-Armory and the leggings from the miner's outfit which I had already re-coloured.

There's no weight slider yet but I will hopefully be able to add that soon.
Oh and I didn't do the boots, they're just the Mage boots from D-Armory (I think maybe originally something vanilla?), and I need to find gauntlets or gloves that work with it.
I also tidied up the esp so all my dress colours are now working in third person.  None of them are working in first person yet, but I never play first person so I don't really care.  
I'm trying not to be a perfectionist for now!  Hopefully I'll figure that out at some point.

### Day 4
I couldn't sleep this morning so I went through all my mesh folders checking out possible meshes for mashups, and taking quick reference images of them.  That took a while lol.  Then I did a quick mashup.  There are a couple of issues I spotted when I'm in game but I'm really trying to keep the perfectionism in check during this challenge.  I want to make a few more mashups so I'm happy with the process, then my next goals are to get the hang of weight sliders.

### Day 5
A couple more mashups.  I'm now starting to realise some of the things I don't understand yet - I think I exported these with the wrong settings as the body is peeking through the clothing, so I need to work out how to fix that.  I also don't know how to do ground models or first person yet.  Getting those figured out are next on my list of goals.  I also want to modify the mesh of the merchant outfit as I really like the blouse from that and I think it would look cute under these leather jacket/armor things.  But I only need the sleeves so need to get rid of the rest of the dress etc.

Additional Goals  
- Work out correct export settings 
- Recolor pirate blouse bands and miner leggings
- Work out how to apply textures to first person meshes
- Work out how to make ground models
