# 30 Days of Outfit Modding

## Rules

- I have to spend at least five minutes every day on something related to the challenge.
- ~~Spend no more than 30 minutes a day on the challenge.~~ I broke this rule on Day 1 and never looked back.

## Initial Goals

- Learn how to implement texture sets and create a plugin so the re-colours I have already made can be crafted in game
- Personal recolour of Iron Mercenary Light Armor
- A simple armor mashup with plugin so it can be crafted in game
  
### Day 1
I managed to get the plugin created and I can craft the re-coloured dresses in game, but the new texture isn't showing up so clearly I have something pathed wrong somewhere. 
Will try again tomorrow.  I did spend quite a bit longer than 30 mins today but there was a lot of troubleshooting and reloading the game going on.  At one point the dress was invisible, that was a low point.

### Day 2
I redid all the texture linking and tidied things up and it's now working, mostly \(I must have missed one of them so I need to go back in and fix that before I can tick this goal off my list\)
Resources I used to learn how to do this:

### Day 3
I MADE A MASHUP! I am SO excited.  I wanted to start simple - it's a mashup of the top of the Mage outfit from D-Armory and the leggings from the miner's outfit (via Archer Robes from D-Armory) which I had already re-coloured.

There's no weight slider yet but I will hopefully be able to add that soon.
Oh and I didn't do the boots, they're just the Mage boots from D-Armory (I think maybe originally something vanilla?), and I need to find gauntlets or gloves that work with it.
I also tidied up the esp so all my dress colours are now working in third person.  None of them are working in first person yet, but I never play first person so I don't really care.  
I'm trying not to be a perfectionist for now!  Hopefully I'll figure that out at some point.

### Day 4
I couldn't sleep this morning so I went through all my mesh folders checking out possible meshes for mashups, and taking quick reference images of them.  That took a while lol.  Then I did a quick mashup.  There are a couple of issues I spotted when I'm in game but I'm really trying to keep the perfectionism in check during this challenge.  I want to make a few more mashups so I'm happy with the process, then my next goals are to get the hang of weight sliders.

### Day 5
A couple more mashups.  I'm now starting to realise some of the things I don't understand yet - I think I exported these with the wrong settings as the body is peeking through the clothing, so I need to work out how to fix that.  I also don't know how to do ground models or first person yet.  Getting those figured out are next on my list of goals.  I also want to modify the mesh of the merchant outfit as I really like the blouse from that and I think it would look cute under these leather jacket/armor things.  But I only need the sleeves so need to get rid of the rest of the dress etc.

Additional Goals  
- Work out correct export settings 
- Recolor pirate blouse bands and miner leggings
- Work out how to apply textures to first person meshes
- Work out how to make ground models

### Day 6
While I think about how to deal with the clipping issues, I did the mossy green recolor of the pirate blouse and miner leggings.  I'm not 100% happy with the leggings colour, I might revisit that.  

### Day 7
Not a lot of energy today so I didn't feel like engaging with xedit or CK, so I did some recolours instead. The Cherry Red dress I used the recolour adjustment layer (in Affinity Photo). I have been experimenting with different methods of doing recolours.  Previously I had just used the recolour brush.  I don't really understand how any of these tools work but the recolour brush is based on the colour of the original layer and therefore the re-colours you can achieve with it can be limited, or at least that's what I've found.

### Day 8
Progress!  I watched Dragoon23's videos on making weight sliders and armor mashups again yesterday for probably the 10th time, and it finally clicked.  So now I have resolved the clipping (I needed to delete the vertices from the mesh bits that were underneath other layers, plus duplicate my body then delete the whole thing except for areas where skin is showing, then export as NIF without reference).  So now I have no clipping AND weight sliders, yay!  The body I'm using is very similar at 0 and 100 weight so it's hard to tell the difference, but I could see the outfit changing when I changed the weight in race menu. Now I've sorted that out, next on my list is to re-do my favourites of the earlier mashups and add the red dress to my dress recolours.

### Day 9
Decided to tackle the Mercenary Light Iron Armor recolour I wanted to do, but instead of a recolour I decided to make a new mashup very heavily inspired by the original.  I didn't get it finished, but now I look at the two together, I think I prefer the original so I might scrap the mashup and just do the recolour as I'd initially planned.  All good practice though.

### Day 10
One third of the way through my challenge! I continued working on the Mercenary Light Iron recolour and I think I've probably gone as far with it as I want - perfectionism is not my friend, and I'd rather move on to something new than get bogged down in tweaking the exact shade of brown of the corset lol. So yeah I'm going to call this done (well once I've made the mod so I can actually use it in game) and move on to some more mashups.  
![](/Images/Day10.png)  
I'm already looking at this picture and thinking... maybe I should have tried a few different shades of brown for the belt... No! I am moving on lol

### Day 11
I managed to get some recent projects in game (and I figured out applying first person textures)

### Day 12
New outfit for Bryn to wear to try and flog his dodgy elixirs.  It's just the white Witcher Prologue shirt with the dark retexture for the trousers, but I did refit it for the body I use.  And I think I deleted a bit too much of his chest, so I need to fix that.  More practice creating plugins though, which is good.

### Day 13
I finally gave in and downloaded Apachi Divine Elegance, which I've been putting off because it's soooo big and I'm on mobile internet. Anyway I'm very glad I did download it because I love the Witcher stuff and there are loads of them in there, including, and this is really the reason I downloaded it, a female version of the Prologue outfit.  So I made a bit of a mashup with that, and the cute jacket thing, in a couple of colour variations.  I would love to do some more recolours on these, I love them and they're very much my preferred style

### Day 14
Was too tired to do much today, but I went through all the Apachii Divine Elegance stuff and found lots more really nice armours to play with.
One of them is this armour [Rough Leather Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23725) which is an old favourite that I'd forgotten about. I thought I might do a recolour, so I set up a mask for the metalwork.

### Day 15
Did a couple of recolours of the Rough Leather Armor, but I didn't like how they turned out.

### Day 16
I've got a bit distracted by other types of modding the last few days, but I have managed to do at least 5 minutes each day, although it has very much felt like I'm only doing it so I can tick it off my list lol. But I do really want to pull everything I've already done together so I can actually have them in game, with associated gloves/gauntlets and boots.  Then I give myself permission to move on to something else.  Today all I did was start the task of getting all my textures and meshes organized ready for making my plugin.

### Day 17
Slogging through creating the plugin.  Selected boots, gloves and hood to pair with this mashup, which I also ended up remaking.  In my first version I used the pirate blouse from zzjay, which is slipping off one shoulder in a way that is sexy but didn't feel very sensible in what is supposed to be armor... and I found a version of the same blouse from the Fiona armor that isn't slipping off the shoulder, which makes me happy.

### Day 18
Got another outfit added to my plugin, BUT I tested the two I've already done in game and I'm getting very bad clipping with the gloves I chose, and I accidentally used an old mesh for one of the outfits that has bad clipping. That should be an easy fix.  I'm not sure what to do about the gloves.

### Day 19
Carrying on adding outfits to my plugin.  

### Day 20
Randomly decided to play as a mage for my next playthrough so obviously I need mage robes.  Made a quick mashup and recolour.

### Day 21
I did some more recolouring and tried my mage mashup in game to see if it's worth messing with it.  The clipping is TERRIBLE, so that will need some finessing, but I think it looks cute so I'll try and reduce it to tolerable levels. 
![](/Images/Day21.png)

### Day 22
Did more recolouring and sorted almost all the clipping out. Still some clipping but it's tolerable.
![](/Images/Day22.png)  

### Days 23 - 25
Battling to try and get the mage robes to appear in game.  They were invisble, no doubt due to me messing up the texture paths somewhere along the way.

### Day 26
I added non-armor versions of my mashups to my plugin, and added boots for each outfit.  Didn't bother with gloves as I'm not going to wear then as a mage. I'll add them in later when I want light armor versions of everything.  I also had a go at a mashup for Taliesin but I wasn't wild about it, and then I tried him in the Mage outfit from D-Armory and he looks so good in that that I'm not going to bother making something different.  But I did like the Witcher Prologue boots on him, so I'll probably give him them to go with the outfit.

### Day 27
Been trying, and failing, to fix some invisible boots.  I've double checked everything - armor add-on and armor records, texture and mesh paths.  Can't see what the issue is. Anyway I'm giving up for today because I've had enough lol.  Will try again tomorrow.  I did fix the fact that I had set the craftable condition to be forge and changed that to tanning rack for the clothing.  So at least I managed to get something right today.
